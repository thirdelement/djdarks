-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The colours are dark purple, blue and violet with one page of black, grey and orange/yellow.  The navbar is black so it is prominent against all background images.
        
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Audioweb font has been used for the DRKS navbar brand logo, jumbotron header and page headers with Sans Serif as the fallback.  This font is used to give a modern style in keeping with DRKS’ music.
            <h2 align="left"><img src="assets/images/readme-images/drks-logo.jpg"></h2>  
        -   The Racing Sans One font has been used for the sub-heading in the jumbotron.  This is similar to the La Macchina font made famous on the Lamborghini logo.  It is used to contrast with the Audioweb logo font, emphasize a stylish, quality product and service.
            <h2 align="left"><img src="assets/images/readme-images/sub-heading.jpg"></h2>  
        -   The Roboto Mono font has been used for the About page text.  This is a monospace font which is not only known for its readability but also customary on typewriters and typesetting computer code.  It brings a technical, computer-based feel to the site which is again similar to DRKS’ music. 
            <h2 align="left"><img src="assets/images/readme-images/about-text.jpg"></h2> 
        -   The Font colour used throughout is whitesmoke for readability and to reduce glare.  When hovering over navbar menu links a contrasting blue is used to match the purple, blue and violet page backgrounds.  
            <h2 align="left"><img src="assets/images/readme-images/blue-menu-link.jpg"></h2>
        -   All forms are in grey with some transparency so as not to detract from the background images.  The submit buttons are red/pink for the sign-up and contact forms and yellow for booking dates.  The red/pink is a standard call-to-action colour and contrasts well with the background image.  Yellow is used for the booking buttons to match the orange filter in the DJ image on the Dates page.
            <h2 align="left"><img src="assets/images/readme-images/signup-form.jpg"></h2>
            <h2 align="left"><img src="assets/images/readme-images/booking-form.jpg"></h2>
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The Home page background image is a close-up of some DJ decks immediately illustrating the site subject matter.
            <h2 align="left"><img src="assets/images/readme-images/home-page.jpg"></h2>  
        -   The About page background image is the Croydon skyline at night in south London.  This provides some context to the biographical text.  The page also features a portrait picture of DRKS to help the visitor relate to his story.
            <h2 align="left"><img src="assets/images/readme-images/about-page.jpg"></h2> 
        -   The Mixes page background image is a scene from a nightclub.  This is appropriate as it is the type of venue you might hear DRKS’ music.  
            <h2 align="left"><img src="assets/images/readme-images/mixes-page.jpg"></h2>
        -   The Dates page background image is similarly from a nightclub or concert venue.  This is an atmospheric shot featuring blue lighting and dry ice clouds.  On top of this there is an image of DRKS in action with an orange filter which stands out well against the blue. 
            <h2 align="left"><img src="assets/images/readme-images/dates-page.jpg"></h2>
        -   The Contacts page background image takes us back to the DJ decks as tools of the trade and emphasising again the subject nature of the website.  
            <h2 align="left"><img src="assets/images/readme-images/contact-page.jpg"></h2>
   
*   ### Wireframes 

    -   Desktop and mobile wireframes - [View](https://github.com/thirdelement/djdarks/blob/master/DJDRKS-wireframes.pdf)

### Further Testing

-   The website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox and Safari browsers.
-   The website viewing experience and functionality was checked on devices including Desktop, laptop, tablet, iPad, iPhone X, iPhone SE and Samsung S10e.  A broader range of simulated devices were used using the Google Developer features and Responsinator.com website.
-   Thorough testing of features and links were completed by the developer, friends, family and professional associates.

### Known Bugs

-   At a screen width below 270px the booking form spills outside the container div.  This is below the minimum screen width of any device tested (280px – Galaxy Fold) and so no further fix was implemented.
-   In Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 the Twitter feed often does not load.  On Twitter’s website IE11 is not listed as a compatible browser (see About twitter.com supported browsers).
-   In Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 the SoundCloud banner borders are not removed.
